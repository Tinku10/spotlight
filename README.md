##### A web music player using Spotify API

#### NOTE

As the backend is not hosted as of now, ```Favourites``` is not available. So you will not be able to add a music to favourites section.

The token returned by Spotify for validation has to be generated by you as I am not using the proper authentication flow.

If you want to use the proper way of doing this

* Make a backend.
* From the frontend redirect to the backend's appropriate uri which will go to Spotify auth url.
* From there after all the steps it will return to the ```redirect_uri``` you gave in the ```Spotify Dashboard```.
* Now in the backend you will capture the ```token``` returned by Spotify and send it to the frontend.
* The frontend will store this token in ```localStorage``` (or wherever you want).
* The application in the frontend will use this token for successive requests.

If you want to use the player (without the above steps) perform the following steps. Here some of the steps are bypassed to get the ```token``` directly.

```
https://accounts.spotify.com/authorize?client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID&response_type=token&redirect_uri=https://dev-w738k3gh.auth0.com/login/callback
```
1. Go to this url
1. Replace the ```client_id``` with your client_id
2. Press enter
3. You will be redirected to the ```redirect_uri``` containing the access token
4. Copy the token and add a row to the ```localStorage``` by the name ```token``` and paste this token there.

And that's all, now you will be able to access all the songs and albums.
