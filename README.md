* A web music player using Spotify API

#### NOTE

As the backend is not hosted as of now, ```Favourites``` is not available. So you will not be able to add a music to favourites section.

The token returned by Spotify for validation has to be generated by you as I am not using the authentication flow for getting the token in the backend and then returning it to the frontend for successive calls to the API.
This is done because backend is not hosted as of now. 

If you want to use the player perform the following steps:

```
https://accounts.spotify.com/authorize?client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID&response_type=token&redirect_uri=https://dev-w738k3gh.auth0.com/login/callback
```
-- replace the client_id with your client_id
-- press enter
-- you will be redirected to the redirect_uri containing the access token
-- copy the token and add a row to the localStorage by the name token and paste this token there.

And that's all, now you will be able to access all the songs and albums.
